# Database Setup Complete! 🎉

Your Prisma schema and migrations are now ready. Here's what needs to be done on Vercel:

## Required Environment Variables on Vercel

Go to: https://vercel.com/ppgamedevs/imob/settings/environment-variables

Add these variables (for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**):

### From Your Vercel Postgres Database:

1. **POSTGRES_URL** (or DATABASE_URL)
   - Get from: Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Postgres → .env.local tab
   - Should look like: `postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-....neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

2. **AUTH_SECRET**

   ```
   tUejT95fbzfRaYW2amXGS5RzUc811SQiKccBN+7Xaco=
   ```

3. **AUTH_URL**
   - Production: `https://imob-three.vercel.app`
   - Preview: Leave empty (auto-detected)
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000`

4. **NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ENABLED** (Optional - for future Google OAuth)
   ```
   false
   ```

## What Happens on Next Deploy:

1. ✅ `postinstall` runs → Prisma Client generated
2. ✅ `vercel-build` runs:
   - `prisma generate` → Client ready
   - `prisma migrate deploy` → Tables created in database
   - `next build` → App built
3. ✅ Authentication system becomes fully functional!

## After Environment Variables Are Set:

Just trigger a redeploy:

- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
- Click on the latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy" button

## Testing Authentication Flow:

Once deployed:

1. Visit your site at https://imob-three.vercel.app
2. Click "Conectare" button
3. Enter your email
4. Check Vercel logs for the magic link (since we're logging to console in dev mode)
5. Click the link to authenticate
6. You'll be redirected to /dashboard as an authenticated user!

## Current Status:

- ✅ Prisma schema created
- ✅ Migration files generated
- ✅ Build script configured with migration deployment
- ✅ Prisma client auto-generation on install
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Waiting for environment variables on Vercel
- ⏳ Waiting for redeploy to run migrations

You're almost there! 🚀

## Verificare: câte apartamente sunt scrape-uite vs în DB

**Din terminal (cu `.env` / `.env.local` încărcat):**
```bash
pnpm run count-listings
```

**Din API (necesită `ADMIN_TOKEN` în env):**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" https://your-app/api/admin/stats
```

În răspuns:
- `ingestion.crawl.detailDone` = URL-uri de anunț scrape-uite cu succes (CrawlJob kind=detail, status=done)
- `ingestion.totalExtractedListings` = total anunțuri cu date în baza de date (ExtractedListing)
- `ingestion.doneAnalyses` = analize finalizate (cu scoring etc.)
