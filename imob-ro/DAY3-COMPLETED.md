# Ziua 3 — "Analizează un link" (Completed)

Date: 2025-10-16

Summary
-------
Implemented the "Analizează un link" page and API described in the prompt. The implementation includes URL validation & normalization, deduplication for recent analyses (<7 days), creating Analysis records, and launching a placeholder background worker to finish the analysis.

What I implemented
- Page: `src/app/analyze/page.tsx`
  - Client form with URL input and an "Analizează" button.
  - States: idle, fetching, done.
  - On submit: POSTs to `/api/analyze`, and redirects to `/report/[id]` when an id is returned.
  - Note: This uses client-side fetch for simplicity. If you prefer a Next Server Action (form action), I can convert it.

- API route: `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts`
  - Accepts POST JSON `{ url }`.
  - Sanitizes/normalizes URLs (removes hash + common utm_ and fbclid params).
  - Dedupes: if an `Analysis` with same `sourceUrl` exists and was created within the last 7 days, returns that id (with `reused: true`).
  - Otherwise creates a new `Analysis` with `status='queued'` and returns its id.
  - Launches `startAnalysis(analysisId, url)` in background using `Promise.allSettled`.

- Background starter: `src/lib/analysis.ts`
  - `startAnalysis(analysisId, url)` — placeholder worker that marks the analysis `running` and after a small timeout marks it `completed` (or `failed` on error).
  - Replace this with your job queue or worker in production (Redis/BullMQ, external worker, serverless function, etc.).

Other changes
- Created `prisma/seed.js` and `package.json` script `pnpm run seed` for inserting a sample Analysis + ExtractedListing into the DB (used during testing).
- Replaced an `<img>` in `src/components/listing-card.tsx` with Next's `Image` to address performance lint warnings.
- `.env.local` updated (locally) with the Neon DB connection you provided so migrations could run.

Quality gates & verification
- Prisma migration: applied (no pending migrations). ✅
- Prisma client: generated. ✅
- TypeScript typecheck: PASS ✅
- ESLint: PASS (no errors; warnings where noted) ✅
- Prettier/format: applied to new files ✅
- Next build: PASS (production build completed) ✅

Files added/edited (high level)
- Added: `src/app/analyze/page.tsx` (page + client form)
- Added: `src/app/api/analyze/route.ts` (API route)
- Added: `src/lib/analysis.ts` (startAnalysis placeholder)
- Edited: `src/components/listing-card.tsx` (use Next Image)
- Added: `prisma/seed.js` and package.json `seed` script
- Edited: `imob-ro/.env.local` (local DB variables — keep this out of VCS)

Notes & recommendations
- Server Action vs client fetch: the page uses client fetch. If you want true Server Actions (Next form actions), I can convert the page to a server action that directly calls the API route and returns a redirect response.
- Background processing: integrate a real worker/queue for robust analysis (and to avoid relying on setTimeout). I can help wire that up.
- Dedupe window: currently hard-coded to 7 days; we can make it configurable via env var.

Next steps (pick one)
- Convert the page to use Next Server Action (form action) so the redirect happens server-side.
- Implement the real analysis worker (enqueue jobs to Redis/BullMQ or call an external worker).
- Implement `/report/[id]` skeleton page to render analysis status and results.

If you want me to proceed with any of the next steps, tell me which and I'll implement it and then create the Day-3 completed file in your preferred format (we already created this one).
